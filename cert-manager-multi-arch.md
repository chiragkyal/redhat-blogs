# Manage certificates on OpenShift running on IBM Z®, IBM Power® and ARM64 architectures.


## Intoduction
The [cert-manager](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/security/cert_manager_operator/index.html) Operator for Red Hat OpenShift provides a secure and efficient solution for SSL/TLS certificate management in OpenShift Container Platform clusters, by introducing certificates and certificate issuers as primary resources in the Kubernetes API.  This _**'certificates as a service'**_ model seamlessly integrates with external certificate authorities, automating the entire certificate lifecycle, from provisioning to renewal, ensuring validity and timely updates.

Now, with the latest update, the cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift `v1.13.0` has undergone an expansion in its scope. Formerly confined to supporting solely on `AMD64` architecture, it now includes extended support for managing certificates on OpenShift across multiple architectures, including IBM Z® (`s390x`), IBM Power® (`ppc64le`), and `ARM64`. 

In this article, I'll briefly explore multi-arch container images before delving into the process of setting up an OpenShift cluster on IBM Power®. I'll then proceed to the cert-manager Operator installation on Power VS and demonstrate its use in certificate management. 

It's worth noting that comparable steps can be applied to other supported architectures. **[TODO] I've provided links to relevant documents for further reference.**

So, let's begin!

## Deploy OpenShift cluster on IBM Power VS
~~Umm! lots of theory. Now let's dive into practical implementation.~~

Enough theory! Let's jump into hands-on practical implementation.

To begin, we'll deploy OpenShift Container Platform on IBM Power® Virtual Server (VS) using installer-provisioned infrastructure. It's essential to first review the [prerequisite documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/installing/installing_ibm_powervs/preparing-to-install-on-ibm-power-vs.html), which includes configuring your IBM Cloud account and other necessary utilities.

### Create IBM Power VS workspace
1. Login to IBM Cloud
```shell!
$ ibmcloud login --sso
```


2. Export IBM Cloud API Key

If you do not possess an API Key, refer to [this document](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui) for guidance on creating one.
```shell!
$ export IBMCLOUD_API_KEY=<api-key>
```





3. Create a new resource group

Execute the following command to create a resource group with the name `sandbox-rg`. Feel free to choose a different name if desired. After creating the resource group, export its ID for use in the subsequent steps.
```shell!
$ export RESOURCE_GROUP=sandbox-rg

$ ibmcloud resource group-create $RESOURCE_GROUP
```
The `ibmcloud resource groups` command can be helpful to get the ID.
```shell!
$ export RESOURCE_GROUP_ID=<resource-group-id>
```


4. Install or update the `power-iaas` CLI plug-in to interact with the Power Virtual Server.

```shell!
$ ibmcloud plugin install power-iaas
```


5. Create Power Server Workspace

```shell!
$ export WORKSPACE_NAME=sandbox-vs-ws

$ export DATACENTER=dal10
```
> `WORKSPACE_NAME` : The virtual server workspace instance name.
> 
> `DATACENTER` : The datacenter where the instance will be hosted.
> Use `ibmcloud pi datacenters` command to see possible values.

Now create it!
```shell!
$ ibmcloud pi workspace-create $WORKSPACE_NAME --datacenter $DATACENTER --group $RESOURCE_GROUP_ID --plan public
```

After creating the workspace, save its GUID as `WORKSPACE_ID`. Utilize the `ibmcloud pi workspaces` command for assistance.
```shell!
$ export WORKSPACE_ID=<workspace-id>
```



### Download ccoctl, installer and oc utilities

To install the OpenShift cluster, we'll need to download the following utilities:

- Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) utility (`ccoctl`): Used for managing cloud credentials externally from the cluster.
- OpenShift installation program (`openshift-install`): This tool is essential for creating cluster components.
- OpenShift command-line tool (`oc`): Enables interaction with the created cluster from the command line (CLI).


>Note: If your host machine is of type `x86_64`, proceed with the provided instructions. If your host operating system and architecture are different, visit the [Infrastructure Provider for Power VS](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/powervs/installer-provisioned) page to download the programs compatible with your setup.

1. Create an `assets` folder to organize and store all necessary files.
```shell!
$ mkdir ~/assets && cd ~/assets
```



2. Download and extract `ccoctl` binary
```shell!
$ curl -O https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/amd64/clients/ocp/stable/ccoctl-linux.tar.gz
```
```shell!
$ tar -xvf ./ccoctl-linux.tar.gz && rm ./ccoctl-linux.tar.gz
```



3. Download and extract  `openshift-install`  binary
```shell!
$ curl -O https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/ppc64le/clients/ocp/stable/openshift-install-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
```shell!
$ tar -xvf ./openshift-install-linux-amd64.tar.gz && rm ./openshift-install-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```



4. Download and extract `oc` binary
```shell!
$ curl -O https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/stable/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
```
```shell!
$ tar -xvf ./openshift-client-linux.tar.gz && rm ./openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
```



5. Once all downloads are complete, ensure that the `assets` directory contains four binaries. You may also use the `--help` command to verify compatibility with your system for each binary.

```shell!
$ ls
ccoctl  kubectl  oc  openshift-install
$ ./ccoctl --help
....
$ ./openshift-install --help
...
```

### Create cluster installation manifests

**Prerequisites**

* [SSH key pair for cluster node access](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/installing/installing_ibm_powervs/installing-ibm-power-vs-customizations.html#ssh-agent-using_installing-ibm-power-vs-customizations)
* [Red Hat OpenShift Pull secret](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret)


1. Create `cluster-assets` directory inside `assets` directory to store the files required for cluster installation.

```shell!
$ mkdir cluster-assets
```

2. Generate the configuration file

```shell!
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir ./cluster-assets
```

Upon executing this command, provide the following information when prompted

```shell
./openshift-install create install-config --dir ./cluster-assets

? SSH Public Key /home/sandbox/.ssh/id_rsa.pub                           <your ssh pub key>
? Platform powervs                                                       <select powervs>
? IBM Cloud User ID abc@example.com                                      <your ibm cloud id>
? Region dal                                                             <power vs workspace region>
? Zone dal10                                                             <power vs workspace zone : echo $DATACENTER>
? Service Instance abcd123-efgh456-qwer-sdf-864gsj123                    <power vs workspace guid : echo $WORKSPACE_ID>
? Resource Group sandbox-rg                                              <power vs workspace resource group : echo $RESOURCE_GROUP>
? Base Domain example.com                                                <the base domain to deploy the cluster to>
? Cluster Name sandbox-cluster                                           <your cluster name>
? Pull Secret *********                                                  <your openshift pull secret> 
```

After execution, the installation program will store the configuration in 
`./cluster-assets/install-config.yaml` file.

You can view the contents by running `cat ./cluster-assets/install-config.yaml`, which will resemble like:

```yaml!
additionalTrustBundlePolicy: Proxyonly
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: example.com
compute:
- architecture: ppc64le
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: worker
  platform: {}
  replicas: 3
controlPlane:
  architecture: ppc64le
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: master
  platform: {}
  replicas: 3
credentialsMode: Manual
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: sandbox-cluster
networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  machineNetwork:
  - cidr: 192.168.18.0/24
  networkType: OVNKubernetes
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16
platform:
  powervs:
    powervsResourceGroup: sandbox-rg
    region: dal
    serviceInstanceID: abcd123-efgh456-qwer-sdf-864gsj123
    userID: IBMid-1234abcd
    zone: dal10
publish: External
pullSecret: '{"auths": ...}'
sshKey: ssh-ed25519 AAAA...
```



By using this configuration, a cluster with 3 master and 3 worker nodes will be generated. If needed, feel free to customize the `install-config.yaml` file according to your requirements.


4. Generate the installation manifests files

And now we'll consume the previously created config file to generate the manifests files.

```shell!
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir ./cluster-assets
```

You will notice several files have been generated within `./cluster-assets` directory, and all will be utilized during the cluster installation. I'm not going into detailed explanations of each file's usage at this point.



### Identity and access management

Next in the cluster installation process is providing IAM roles for IBM Cloud resources, using the `ccoctl` tool.


1. Create `cco-assets` directory inside `assets` directory to store `CredentialsRequest` custom resources (CRs)

```shell!
$ mkdir cco-assets
```

2. Get your OpenShift release image from the installer binary

```shell!
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
```

3. Now, run the following command to extract all `CredentialsRequest` CRs from the `RELEASE_IMAGE` and store them inside `cco-assets` directory.

```shell!
$ ./oc adm release extract --cloud=powervs --credentials-requests $RELEASE_IMAGE --to ./cco-assets
```

4. Upon extracting all CRs, we'll utilize `ccoctl` to create service ID API Keys for each `CredentialsRequest` with designated policies. Subsequently, this process will generate YAML files of secrets inside the manifests directory, granting essential identity and access management for your `sandbox-cluster`.


```shell!
$ ./ccoctl ibmcloud create-service-id --credentials-requests-dir ./cco-assets --name sandbox-cluster --output-dir ./cluster-assets
```

Verify that the necessary YAML files have been saved in `cluster-assets/manifests` directory. Sample output:


```shell
Saved credentials configuration to: cluster-assets/manifests/openshift-cloud-controller-manager-ibm-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
Saved credentials configuration to: cluster-assets/manifests/openshift-machine-api-powervs-credentials-credentials.yaml
Saved credentials configuration to: cluster-assets/manifests/openshift-image-registry-installer-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
Saved credentials configuration to: cluster-assets/manifests/openshift-ingress-operator-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
Saved credentials configuration to: cluster-assets/manifests/openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-ibm-powervs-cloud-credentials-credentials.yaml
```

These secrets, along with other manifest files, will be applied during cluster creation, ensuring proper access to the required resources.

### Deploy the cluster

Congratulations on successfully following these steps! Now, just run the command, sit back, and take a moment to relax. Your cluster creation process will be underway, and soon you'll have your OpenShift cluster ready, running on IBM Power Virtual Server. :tada:  :relieved: 



```shell!
$ ./openshift-install create cluster --dir ./cluster-assets
```

After a successful cluster deployment, instructions will be displayed for accessing your cluster, offering a web console link, `kubeadmin` user credentials, and the `kubeconfig` file path. Any of these options can be utilized to access the cluster. :100:
